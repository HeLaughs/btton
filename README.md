# Button Project

This project demonstrates a simple interactive button built with modern development workflow.

  The page displays a large, rounded button in the center.
  The button says “CLICK ME!”.
  On hover, a purple background slides under the text and the text color turns white.
  On click, an alert pops up: Button clicked!
